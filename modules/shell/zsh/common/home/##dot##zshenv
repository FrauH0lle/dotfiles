# Zsh startup, Solus specific:

# /usr/share/defaults/etc/zsh/zshenv
# Used for setting environment variables for all users; it should not contain
# commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a TTY. When
# this file exists it will always be read, this cannot be overridden.

# $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
# Used for setting user's environment variables; it should not contain commands
# that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a TTY. When this file
# exists it will always be read.

# /usr/share/defaults/etc/zsh/zprofile
# Used for executing commands at start for all users, will be read when starting
# as a login shell. By default it contains a line which sources /etc/profile.

# /etc/profile
# This file should be sourced by all POSIX sh-compatible shells upon login: it
# sets up $PATH and other environment variables and application-specific
# (/etc/profile.d/*.sh) settings upon login.

# $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
# Used for executing user's commands at start, will be read when starting as a
# login shell. Typically used to autostart graphical sessions and to set
# session-wide environment variables.

# /usr/share/defaults/etc/zsh/zshrc
# Used for setting interactive shell configuration and executing commands for
# all users, will be read when starting as an interactive shell.

# $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
# Used for setting user's interactive shell configuration and executing
# commands, will be read when starting as an interactive shell.

# /usr/share/defaults/etc/zsh/zlogin
# Used for executing commands for all users at ending of initial progress, will
# be read when starting as a login shell.

# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
# Used for executing user's commands at ending of initial progress, will be read
# when starting as a login shell. Typically used to autostart command line
# utilities. Should not be used to autostart graphical sessions, as at this
# point the session might contain configuration meant only for an interactive
# shell.

# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
# Used for executing commands when a login shell exits.

# /usr/share/defaults/etc/zsh/zlogout
# Used for executing commands for all users when a login shell exits.
