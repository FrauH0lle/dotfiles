Do not forget to edit /etc/snapper/configs/root and
/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config.

If 'snapper -c root create-config /' causes an error, then:

Unmount /.snapshots if it is mounted

Delete /.snapshots

Run
# snapper -c root create-config /

Now that snapper is happily configured, delete /.snapshots. Note that it is a subvolume - not a folder

# btrfs subvolume delete /.snapshots

Create the mountpoint again
# mkdir /.snapshots
# chmod 750 /.snapshots

Mount the subvol_snapshots subvolume to /.snapshots
# mount /.snapshots
